## **Hello, Iâ€™m Erik Trujillo GuzmÃ¡n! ðŸ‘‹**

I am a last-year Computer Science Engineering student (at Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Madrid).

I consider myself like a very responsible, creative and positive person who always want to learn something new and face new challenges.
I also know how to communicate with other workmates and how to work in a team.

I have experience in programming languages like Java, C and Python.
I also know HTML, CSS and JavaScript in a basic level (and currently learning).
I have worked with IDE Eclipse and text editors like Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text and I know about OS UNIX (Linux) and Microsoft products like Word, PowerPoint, Excel.

Finally, my English level is above B2 (I have a TOEIC certificate) and I also speak French (B1 level).


Thank you for reading! :blush:
